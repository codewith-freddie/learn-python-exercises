# Task: Write a Python script that implements a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
# Include input validation for operations and a persistent loop to ensure the user agrees to a date.

# Explanation: This script combines a basic calculator with input validation and a persistent loop.
# It demonstrates arithmetic operations, conditional logic, error handling for division by zero, and loop control for user input validation.
# This example teaches functions, loops, conditionals, and input handling in Python.
# Suggested title: calculator_with_persistent_loop.py
