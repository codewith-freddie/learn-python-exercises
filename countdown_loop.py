# Task: Write a Python script that demonstrates a countdown using a while loop.
# Start with n=4, print n and decrement until n is not greater than 0, then print the final value.

#LOOPS
#CONCEPT IN PRACTICE No. 2

n = 4
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n - 1
    #n = n + 1
print("value of n after the loops is", n)

# Explanation: This script demonstrates the use of while loops for countdowns and loop termination.
# It decrements n and prints it until the condition fails, then shows the final value.
# This example teaches loop control, decrement operations, and understanding loop exit conditions in Python.
# Suggested title: countdown_loop.py
