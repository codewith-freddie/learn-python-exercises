## 📚 Programs Overview

### 🔄 Loops and Control Structures
Explore the power of iteration and control flow with these examples:

- **persistent_yes_loop.py** 💕: An infinite loop that persistently asks for a 'yes' response.
- **odd_numbers_sum.py** ➕: Calculates the sum of odd numbers using a while loop.
- **odd_even_display.py** 🔢: Displays odd and even numbers through looping.
- **fibonacci_sequence.py** 🌀: Generates the classic Fibonacci sequence.
- **countdown_loop.py** ⏰: Implements a countdown timer with loops.
- **string_iteration.py** 🔤: Demonstrates string character iteration.
- **countdown_for_loop.py** 🔄: Countdown using a for loop.
- **even_numbers_list.py** 📝: Collects even numbers (0-100) into a list.
- **average_differences.py** 📊: Computes average differences between list elements.
- **word_bank_collector.py** 📚: Collects user-input words into a list.

### 🤔 Conditionals and Decision Making
Master decision-making in code with these conditional examples:

- **temperature_converter.py** 🌡️: Converts between temperature units using if-elif-else.
- **speed_range_check.py** 🚗: Validates if a speed is within a specified range.
- **wavelength_color_mapper.py** 🌈: Maps light wavelengths to colors with conditions.
- **meal_selection_menu.py** 🍽️: Interactive menu for meal selection.
- **sequential_if_statements.py** 🔀: Demonstrates chained if statements.
- **input_validation.py** ✅: Ensures user input meets criteria.
- **grade_average_calculator.py** 📈: Calculates grades and determines pass/fail.

### 🗂️ Data Structures
Dive into Python's built-in data structures:

- **list_operations_demo.py** 📋: Showcases various list manipulations.
- **list_dictionary_operations.py** 📖: Operations on lists and dictionaries.
- **list_search.py** 🔍: Implements searching within lists.

### 🛠️ Other Utilities
Additional practical programs:

- **calculator_with_loop.py** 🧮: A persistent calculator in a loop.
- **payroll_calculator.py** 💰: Computes payroll based on hours and rates.
- **nltk_setup.py** 📖: Sets up NLTK for natural language processing.

## ▶️ How to Run

Get started with these simple steps:

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system 🐍
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Run any program individually:

```bash
python filename.py
```

> **Note**: Some programs require additional libraries (e.g., NLTK). Install dependencies as needed.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

These programs will help you grasp:

- 🔄 Basic input/output operations
- 🤔 Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- 🔁 Loops (for, while)
- 📋 List and dictionary operations
- 🔤 String manipulation
- ➗ Basic arithmetic and calculations
- ✅ User input validation
- 🧠 Simple algorithms

## 📝 Note

These are beginner-friendly programs crafted during my Python learning journey. They're perfect for understanding core concepts and serve as a solid reference for Python fundamentals. Happy coding! 🚀
