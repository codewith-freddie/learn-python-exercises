# Basic Python Programs Collection

This repository contains a collection of basic Python programs that I created during my college days. These programs demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, input/output, data structures, and basic algorithms. Each program is designed to illustrate a specific concept or solve a simple problem.

## Programs Overview

### Loops and Control Structures
- **persistent_yes_loop.py**: An infinite loop that repeatedly asks the user if they want to date you, only accepting 'yes' as a valid response.
- **odd_numbers_sum.py**: Uses a while loop to calculate the sum of odd numbers.
- **odd_even_display.py**: Displays odd and even numbers using loops.
- **fibonacci_sequence.py**: Generates the Fibonacci sequence.
- **countdown_loop.py**: Implements a countdown using a loop.
- **string_iteration.py**: Demonstrates iteration over strings.
- **countdown_for_loop.py**: A countdown implemented with a for loop.
- **even_numbers_list.py**: Collects even numbers from 0 to 100 into a list using a for loop.
- **average_differences.py**: Calculates the average of differences between consecutive elements in a list.
- **word_bank_collector.py**: Collects words from user input into a list and displays them.

### Conditionals and Decision Making
- **temperature_converter.py**: Converts temperature units using if-elif-else statements.
- **speed_range_check.py**: Checks if a speed falls within a specified range.
- **wavelength_color_mapper.py**: Maps wavelengths to colors using conditional statements.
- **meal_selection_menu.py**: A menu for selecting meals based on user input.
- **sequential_if_statements.py**: Demonstrates sequential if statements.
- **input_validation.py**: Validates user input.
- **grade_average_calculator.py**: Calculates average grades and determines pass/fail status.

### Data Structures
- **list_operations_demo.py**: Demonstrates various list operations.
- **list_dictionary_operations.py**: Shows operations on lists and dictionaries.
- **list_search.py**: Searches for elements in a list.

### Other Utilities
- **calculator_with_loop.py**: A calculator that runs in a persistent loop.
- **payroll_calculator.py**: Calculates payroll based on hours and rate.
- **nltk_setup.py**: Sets up the NLTK library for natural language processing.

## How to Run

Each Python file can be run individually using Python 3:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Some programs may require additional libraries (e.g., NLTK for nltk_setup.py).

## Learning Objectives

These programs cover:
- Basic input/output operations
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Loops (for, while)
- List and dictionary operations
- String manipulation
- Basic arithmetic and calculations
- User input validation
- Simple algorithms

## Note

These are beginner-level programs created as part of learning Python programming. They serve as examples of fundamental concepts and can be used as a reference for learning Python basics.
